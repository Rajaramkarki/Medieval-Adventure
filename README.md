The artwork used in Medieval Adventure is open-source, and has been edited to fit the game's requirements. The combat system is basic, and there is an NPC with whom you can interact and figure out your next moves. The game has been developed using Unity and coded with C#, while artwork creation was done with Photoshop. Unity Collaboration and Microsoft Visual Studio were used as the version control tool and primary IDE for coding, respectively.

This project was originally created for semester project.


## Map Design
The map is simple and is designed with tile palette in Unity. It has seven blocks/separate rooms created on the maps where transition occurs from one to another.

In one of the rooms, there is a gateway to dungeon whose map is similar to the previous one.

## Players and Enemies
The player is a simple 2D sprite whose basic animations are implemented. Similarly the enemies are logs who tend to attach the player if they appear within the radar of the enemy.
